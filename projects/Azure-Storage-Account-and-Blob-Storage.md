# 💾 Azure Storage Account & Blob Storage

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates creating an **Azure Storage Account**, creating a **Blob Container**, uploading files to Azure Blob Storage, and securely accessing uploaded files using a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**.

During testing, I also encountered the **PublicAccessNotPermitted** error when trying to access the blob using its direct URL. The issue was successfully resolved by generating a SAS URL.

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand Azure Storage Accounts
- Create a Blob Container
- Upload files to Azure Blob Storage
- Learn the difference between Blob URL and SAS URL
- Securely access private blobs using SAS
- Understand Azure Storage security

---

## ☁️ Azure Services Used

- Azure Storage Account
- Azure Blob Storage
- Blob Containers
- Shared Access Signature (SAS)
- Azure Portal

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. Signed in to the Azure Portal.
2. Created a new Resource Group.
3. Created an Azure Storage Account.
4. Created a Blob Container inside the Storage Account.
5. Uploaded an image to the Blob Container.
6. Attempted to access the uploaded file using the Blob URL.
7. Received the **PublicAccessNotPermitted** error because public access was disabled.
8. Generated a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** with Read permissions.
9. Accessed the uploaded file successfully using the generated SAS URL.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

- Azure Storage Account
- Azure Blob Storage
- Blob Containers
- Shared Access Signature (SAS)
- Azure Storage Security
- Azure Portal
- Cloud Storage Management
- Blob URL Testing

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Azure Storage Accounts provide secure cloud storage services.
- Blob Containers are used to organize and store files.
- Public access is disabled by default for better security.
- Blob URLs cannot access private blobs without proper authorization.
- Shared Access Signature (SAS) provides secure, time-limited access to Azure Storage resources.
- SAS URLs allow secure sharing of private files without exposing the Storage Account keys.

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully created an Azure Storage Account, uploaded files to Azure Blob Storage, understood Azure Storage security, resolved the **PublicAccessNotPermitted** error, and securely accessed the uploaded blob using a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Azure Blob Storage is commonly used to:

- Store application images and documents
- Host static website content
- Store application backups
- Archive logs and media files
- Securely share files using Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
- Integrate with Azure Functions, App Services, and Container Apps
